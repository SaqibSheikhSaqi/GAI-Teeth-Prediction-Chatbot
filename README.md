The **"Trainset.pdf"** has been prepared using 50% of the records from the **"7 Common Teeth Disease Dataset"** available at **"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kruphacm/7-common-teeth-disease-dataset"**. It also includes contents from **"15 Tooth Problems"** found at **"https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-tooth-problems"** and **"Top 10 Common Dental Problems and Treatment"** available at **"https://www.kneibdentistry.com/dentistry-blog/10-common-dental-problems-and-treatment"**.

To check the performance of the proposed **"GenerativeAI-Teeth Model"** in predicting diseases and treatments, a **"testDataCSV.csv"** file has been created. This file contains the remaining 50% of the records from the **"7 Common Teeth Disease Dataset"** available at **"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kruphacm/7-common-teeth-disease-dataset"**.

Additionally, to evaluate the model's performance in answering questions about teeth diseases, a manually created question-answer set, **"TestSetQAns.csv"**, has been prepared. This set is based on information from **"https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-tooth-problems"** and **"Top 10 Common Dental Problems and Treatment"** from **"https://www.kneibdentistry.com/dentistry-blog/10-common-dental-problems-and-treatment"**. **"TestSetQAns.txt"** contains the actual answers to all questions, which are then compared with the model's predicted answers to assess performance.
